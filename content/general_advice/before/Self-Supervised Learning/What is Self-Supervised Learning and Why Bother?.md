# What is Self-Supervised Learning and Why Bother?
The goal of this section is to give a brief introduction to Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) and various SSL methods, mostly coming from A Cookbook of Self-Supervised Learning[^1]

SSL is an emerging area of Machine Learning (ML) which is showing a lot of promise. Its main edge over Supervised Learning is the ability to train on vast amounts of unlabeled data. For example, in Computer Vision (CV), models such as SEER[^2] were able to train on 1 billion images.
